There are two ways to pre-process the data and run our classifier:

(1) Use scripts.sh. Step provided for clarity:

        1. Usage: source scripts.sh
        
        *****PREPROCESS*****

        2. To preprocess train data:
                Usage: preprocess
           
           To preprocess train and development data:
                Usage: preprocess_dev

           To preprocess train and test data:
                Usage: preprocess_test
        
        *****CLASSIFY*****

        3. To run 5-fold classification on train data:
                Usage: classify

           To run classification on development data:
                Usage: classify_dev

           To run classification on testing data:
                Usage: classify_test

(2) Manually as specified within write-up. Steps:

        *****PREPROCESS*****

        Usage: python3 preprocess.py <ORIGINAL_FILE PATH> <OUTPUT_FILE PATH>

        *****CLASSIFY*****

        n-fold cross-validation:

        Usage: python3 classifier.py <TRAINING_FILE PATH> n

        No cross-validation:

        Usage: python3 classifier.py <TRAINING_FILE PATH> <TEST_FILE PATH>

Note: Pre-processing should take a few seconds.
Note: Using n-fold cross-validation leads to non-deterministic results as the
chunks for training and testing are random for each run. This may lead to 
different accuracies than those presented in the paper.
